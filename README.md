Congressman Mark Sanford has been bringing jobs to South Carolina throughout his tenure in politics and also bringing in campaign dollars with the state’s business deals.

Congressman Sanford has received campaign donations from multiple businesses with locations in South Carolina. 

Lockheed Martin Corporation Employees PAC donated $1,000 in the latest quarter to Sanford, who started working towards bringing Lockheed Martin to South Carolina in 2006. 

The global security and aerospace company opened a cyber security office, the Center for Information Dominance, in Charleston in April 2015. The city of Charleston is located in Sanford’s 1st District. Lockheed Marin also has a jet production plant in Greenville, South Carolina. 

They began giving to Sanford’s campaign in December 2013 and have donated a total of $6,000.

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association PAC’s donations to Sanford date back to June 2016. He serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee and worked closely with the NATCA to bring upgrades to the software used in the air traffic control tower at the Charleston International Airport last year.

Sanford also cosponsored the Air Traffic Controller Hiring Improvement Act of 2016 to improve the staffing of air traffic controllers.

The NATCA PAC has donated a total of $5,000 to Sanford’s campaign over five different occasions.

The Boeing Company is another business with a notable presence in Charleston. They have donated $22,000 to Sanford since April 2013, most recently giving him $2,000 in the previous quarter. 

Boeing first came to Charleston in 2008, buying out Vought Aircraft Industries, Charleston Operations and Global Aeronautica LLC over two years.

They built two assembly and delivery facilities in Charleston in 2009 and 2016, creating thousands of jobs.

In 2010, The Post and Courier reported that South Carolina lawmakers, including then-Governor Sanford, signed an incentive deal with Boeing to bring more business to Charleston.

Other companies with South Carolina facilities that have donated to Sanford include General Electric, International Paper, which manufactures paper products, and CSX, a rail-based freight transportation company.

Sanford has represented the 1st District of South Carolina in the U.S. House of Representatives since May 2013. He held the same position from 1995-2001 until serving as governor of South Carolina from 2003-2011.
